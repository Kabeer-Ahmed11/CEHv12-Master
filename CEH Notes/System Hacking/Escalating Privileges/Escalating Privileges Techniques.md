## Privilege Escalation Using Spectre and Meltdown Vulnerabilities

### Spectre Vulnerability

The Spectre vulnerability is found in many modern processors, including Apple, AMD, ARM, Intel, Samsung, and Qualcomm processors. This vulnerability allows attackers to trick a processor into exploiting speculative execution to read restricted data. Modern processors implement speculative execution to predict the future to complete the execution faster. 

### Meltdown Vulnerability

Meltdown vulnerability is found in all Intel and ARM processors deployed by Apple. This vulnerability allows attackers to trick a process into accessing out-of-bounds memory by exploiting CPU optimization mechanisms such as speculative execution.
