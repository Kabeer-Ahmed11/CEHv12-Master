## Defending against Buffer Overflows

The following countermeasures can be adopted to defend against buffer overflow attacks: 

▪ Develop programs by following secure coding practices and guidelines. 

▪ Use the address space layout randomization (ASLR) technique, which randomly moves around the address-space locations of the data region.
▪ Validate arguments and minimize code that requires root privileges. 

▪ Perform code review at the source-code level using static and dynamic code analyzers. 

▪ Allow the compiler to add bounds to all the buffers. 

▪ Implement automatic bound checking. 

▪ Always protect the return pointer on the stack. 

▪ Never allow the execution of code outside the code space. 

▪ Regularly patch applications and OSes. 

▪ Perform code inspection manually with a checklist to ensure that the code meets certain criteria.
▪ Employ nonexecutable stacks, i.e., data execution prevention (DEP), which can mark the stack or memory regions as nonexecutable to prevent exploitation.
▪ Implement code pointer integrity checking to detect whether a code pointer has been corrupted before it is dereferenced.
▪ Scrutinize the code thoroughly to avoid possible errors by performing testing and debugging.
▪ Perform automated and manual code auditing. 

▪ Avoid using unsafe functions and use strncat instead of strcat, and strncpy instead of strcpy.
▪ Use the NX bit to mark certain areas of memory as executable and nonexecutable. 

▪ Digitally sign the code before launching the program. 

▪ Ensure that all the control transfers are encompassed by a trusted and approved code image.
▪ Adopt deep packet inspection (DPI) for detecting remote exploitation attempts at the network perimeter using attack signatures.
▪ Consider altering the rules at the OS level, where the memory pages can hold executable data.
▪ Use intrusion detection system (IDS) solutions to detect behavior that simulates an attack.
▪ Implement Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP) to deter attackers from overwriting the exception registration record using the SEH overwrite exploitation technique.
▪ Employ the latest OSes that offer more protection.

▪ Use programming languages such as Python, COBOL, or Java instead of C. 

▪ Ensure the function does not perform a write operation when it reaches the end after determining the buffer’s size.
▪ Audit the libraries and frameworks used to develop source code to ensure that they are not vulnerable.
▪ Use stack canaries, a random value or string of characters, which makes it difficult for attackers to overwrite.
